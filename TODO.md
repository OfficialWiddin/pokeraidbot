Maybe:

* Checking error codes?
* Add counters/counter moves to all pokemon, based on "good dps pokemons" for each type?
* Enable channel admins to configure a server, to choose region/dataset and default locale
* Make locale configurable both on server level, but also for each user to be able to choose locale
* Enable bot owner to trigger import of a regional dataset "on the fly" and save gym region data in database 
(needs non-free Heroku version)
